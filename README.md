Project Title: HR Analytics Dashboard: Visualizing Employee Attrition and Demographics with Power BI

Project Description:
The HR Analytics Dashboard project utilizes Power BI to create an interactive and visually compelling dashboard showcasing employee attrition and demographic trends within an organization. Leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, the dashboard presents key metrics such as attrition rates, employee count, average age, average years spent in the company, and average salary through table, donut, card, and bar visuals.

Key Visualizations:

Employee Count Bar Chart: A bar chart illustrating the total count of employees within different departments or job roles, offering insights into workforce distribution.
Average Age Card: A card displaying the average age of employees across the organization, providing a snapshot of the age demographics.
Average Years in Company Card: A card showcasing the average number of years employees have spent in the company, indicating employee retention rates.
Average Salary Bar Chart: A bar chart presenting the average salary of employees, potentially segmented by job level or department, highlighting salary distribution.


Tools and Technologies:
Data Analysis: Power BI Desktop
Data Source: Kaggle dataset on HR analytics


Expected Outcome:
The HR Analytics Dashboard developed in Power BI provides HR professionals and organizational decision-makers with an intuitive and interactive tool to analyze employee attrition patterns and demographic insights. Through visually rich table, donut, card, and bar visuals, stakeholders can easily interpret key metrics such as attrition rates, employee count, average age, years in the company, and salary distribution, enabling data-driven decision-making to enhance employee retention strategies and overall workforce management.
